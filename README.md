# Titanic

This is my attempt to tackle the classic Titanic passenger survival prediction question on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). 

I have used a decision tree classifier (and tuned its hyperparameters) as well as an ensemble model to achieve 0.79 prediction score, ranking top 24% in the Kaggle leaderboard (as of Apr 2018).
